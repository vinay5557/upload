# Node_JS_File_Upload
 
## Introduction

In this post, we will see how we can upload files or images to the server using Node JS. Here we are going to use Visual Studio for our development and preceding NPM packages for our easy development.

- express
- multer
- body-parser

We will briefly explain the use of these packages. As you all know Node JS is a runtime environment built on Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine for server-side and networking application. And it is an open source which supports cross platforms. Node JS applications are written in pure JavaScript. If you are new to Node JS, I strongly recommend you to read my previous posts about Node JS here https://sibeeshpassion.com/category/node-js/.
